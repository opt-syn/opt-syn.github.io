# Manager


The {class}`manager` class is the highest level class in the {{osyn}} project. The Analysis and Synthesis problems are posed using the {class}`opt_analysis` and {class}`opt_synthesis` classes, respectively. The {class}`manager` classes are invoked in the {doc}`Problem Formulation <../usage/problem_formulation/index_problem_formulation>` page, and their usage is explained in the {doc}`Solve <../usage/solve>` page.



Both the analysis and synthesis routines inherit from {class}`opt_manager_interface`, containing the common methods. 


The core user-facing methods are {meth}`solve_single`, {meth}`bisect`, and (for Synthesis) {meth}`alternate`.
