# Solution


The output of a {meth}`solve_single`, {meth}`bisect`, or {meth}`alternate` run from a {class}`opt_analysis` and {class}`opt_synthesis` {doc}`managers <doc_manager>` is a solution structure. The solution structure is of type {class}`opt_solution`, and is common among Analysis and Synthesis. Dedicated solution certificates for Analysis and Synthesis respectively are stored in the {attr}`cert` field of {class}`opt_solution`.
